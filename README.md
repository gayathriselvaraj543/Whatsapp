# WhatsApp LLD - React Frontend

This is a simple React frontend demonstrating LLD principles for a WhatsApp-like app.

Quick start:

```bash
cd "D:\LLD java\whatsapp\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is intentionally minimal: models are plain JS classes in `src/models` and the UI shows a `ChatList` and `ChatWindow`.
